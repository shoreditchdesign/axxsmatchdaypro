              <h3>2. The data we collect about you</h3>
              <p>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>
              <p>We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li><strong>Identity Data</strong> includes first name, maiden name, last name, username or similar identifier, date of birth and gender.</li>
                <li><strong>Contact Data</strong> includes email address and telephone numbers.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Data</strong> includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and geo-location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and other technology on the devices you use to access this app.</li>

              <p>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>

              <ul role="list">
                <li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>
                <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights, do not override those interests.</li>
                <li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data, although we will get your consent before sending third-party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message or before we share your details with any football clubs. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.</p>
              <h5>Purposes for which we will use your personal data</h5>
              <p>We have set out below in a table format a description of how we plan to use your personal data and which legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate.</p>
              <p>Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground, depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal ground we rely on to process your personal data where more than one ground has been set out in the table below.</p>
              <p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We have established the following personal data control mechanisms:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li><strong>Promotional offers from us:</strong> We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services, new games and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).</li>
                <li><strong>Not opting out:</strong> You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or entered a contest on our app, and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-party marketing:</strong> We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Opting out:</strong> You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by emailing us or by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time. Where you opt out of receiving our marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of you entering a contest on the app, providing details of your product/service experience or other transactions.</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Cookies</h5>
              <p>When you visit our website, we will ask for your consent to place any non-essential cookies on your device. We also offer you the option to adjust your cookie settings on our website. By clicking the &quot;Cookies&quot; button, you can choose which non-essential cookies you want to activate on our website and which you want to deactivate.

              <h5>Change of purpose</h5>
              <p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to receive an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.</p>
              <p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
              <p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
              <h3>5. Disclosures of your personal data</h3>

              </ul>

                <li>In the case of the UK, we will rely on the EU-UK agreements on personal data processing.</li>

              <h3>7. Data security</h3>
              <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
              <p>Access to our personal data databases is restricted and only individuals with validated queries and a business reason may gain access. Neither our developers nor service managers have direct instances to our personal data databases. All actions are logged. Data is not kept at any personal devices, nor can it be copied to a USB stick or remote storage drive.</p>
              <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
              <h3>8. Data retention</h3>
              <h5>How long will you use my personal data for?</h5>
              <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>
              <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements. We utilise automated database scripts to delete the majority of the personal data that we hold. Typically speaking:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>We retain Technical Data for a maximum of one year and Usage Data for an extended duration;</li>
                <li>Transaction Data and some Financial data, such as fraud, we will retain for six years; and</li>
                <li>Most other data we will retain for as long you have the AXXS app installed for, plus two years.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy which you can request from us by contacting us.</p>
              <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see “Your legal rights” below for further information.</p>
              <p>In some circumstances we will anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
              <h3>9. Your legal rights</h3>
              <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>Request access to your personal data.</li>
                <li>Request correction of your personal data.</li>
                <li>Request erasure of your personal data.</li>
                <li>Object to processing of your personal data.</li>
                <li>Request restriction of processing your personal data.</li>
                <li>Request transfer of your personal data.</li>
                <li>Right to withdraw consent.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.</p>
              <h5>Usually no fee required</h5>
              <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
              <h5>What we may need from you</h5>
              <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
              <h5>Time limit to respond</h5>
              <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
              <h3>10. Glossary</h3>
              <h5>LAWFUL BASIS</h5>
              <p><strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</p>
              <p><strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>
              <p><strong>Comply with a legal obligation</strong> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.</p>
              <h5>THIRD PARTIES</h5>
              <p><strong>External Third Parties</strong></p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>Service providers acting as processors based in the EU who provide IT, system administration services and marketing services.</li>
                <li>Professional advisers based in the EU or UK acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.</li>
                <li>Professional football clubs to whom we will only transfer your personal data with your consent.</li>
                <li>Any subsidiaries or holding companies who need to receive your personal data in order to allow us to fulfil our obligations under this privacy policy or any agreement that we may have with you.</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h5>
              <p>You have the right to:</p>
              <p><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a &quot;data subject access request&quot;). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
              <p><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
              <p><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
              <p><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
              <p><strong>Request restriction</strong> of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>If you want us to establish the data&#x27;s accuracy.</li>
                <li>Where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
                <li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
                <li>You have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
              <p><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> when we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
